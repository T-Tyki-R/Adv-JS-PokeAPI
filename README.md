# Adv-JS-PokeAPI

This project is to demostrate my understanding of using advance javascript functionalities:
1. Object and Object Manipulation
2. DOM Utilization
3. API Fetching and Handling
4. Asynchronization/Synchronization Handling

The focal point of this is utilizing API handling, using PokeAPI, to fetch pokemon object data to display
vital information about said pokemon (i.e., Pikachu, ID 25 will display sprites, stats, etc...).

User must input either a pokemon's correct name of ID number to display its information and image.

If users fail to input the correct information or any information, they will receive either an error or an alert.
